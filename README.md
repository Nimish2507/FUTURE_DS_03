This project is the final milestone of my Data Science & Analytics Internship at Future Interns. The goal of this task was to analyze student survey data to uncover satisfaction trends and provide actionable improvements for educational programs.

Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and quantitative data analysis, I transformed raw survey weightage data into a visual dashboard that highlights areas of excellence and opportunities for growth.

Key Features
Automated Data Cleaning: Handled special character encoding (Latin-1) and stripped hidden whitespace from survey categories.
Sentiment Analysis: Applied the TextBlob library to calculate polarity and categorize student feedback into Positive, Neutral, and Negative sentiments.
Data Visualization: Developed a multi-chart dashboard including bar charts for course performance, pie charts for sentiment distribution, and Word Clouds for thematic analysis

Tools & Technologies Used
Language: Python (Google Colab).
Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and score extraction.
TextBlob: For Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For generating statistical visualizations.
WordCloud: For identifying high-frequency feedback themes.
Mini-Report & Insights
Overall Sentiment: The majority of responses show a Positive sentiment, indicating high general satisfaction with teacher preparation and communication.

Top Performing Course: Based on the data analysis, the highest satisfaction score was achieved by the top-rated course in the bar chart.

Recommendation: For courses with lower "Average/Percentage" scores, focus should be shifted toward better "Syllabus Coverage" and "Internal Evaluation Fairness" to improve the overall student experience.
